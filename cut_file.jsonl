Thank you for contacting me, I think I will be able to assist you. Are you looking for a flat to buy or to rent?\r\nTom: This is one of the things we've been discussing with my wife. What are the current trends? Which option do you suggest?\r\nDiana: It depends on what you value more, it may sound obvious, but if you value stability more than flexibility, I would suggest you invest in buying a flat.\r\nTom: We were looking for something bigger than what we own now, but we may not have a budget for something we may need in the future.\r\nDiana: In this case I would suggest maybe buying something smaller to rent and renting at the same time a small flat to save or buying something slightly below the budget, so you could save for later.\r\nTom: Thank you! This is a great advice!\r\nTom: I will talk to my wife, but for now, I think we could focus on buying something similar size.\r\nDiana: How many rooms are you looking for?\r\nTom: Two bedrooms at least, joined kitchen and living room is fine as well.\r\nDiana: Do you have any preferred neighbourhood?\r\nTom: Anywhere near the tube station within zone 3 is acceptable.\r\nDiana: Thank you.

And as usual I have no idea what they have sent me.\r\nTarquin: Did you make an event on Facebook?\r\nQuentin: Yes I did. You didn't see it?\r\nTarquin: I haven't been on for a few days. Actually I got a ban for making a joke which offended someone. It involved a penguin, which as you know can be a very offensive topic.\r\nQuentin: I don't know. People today as so sensitive, but are ignorant anyway.\r\nTarquin: So will you have a good crowd for the unboxing? \r\nQuentin: Only seven for definite. I will do some wine and cheese and we can start opening the boxes at 8pm\r\nTarquin: Sounds great. I will turn up. \r\nQuentin: Great.\r\nTarquin: How many books do you think there will be?\r\nQuentin: About 200, like the other time.\r\nTarquin: how many did you sell on the spot? \r\nQuentin: Only 30, the rest went into the shop. But the prices are better than the labels I would put on them, especially when you get an impromptu auction going. Nigel always likes to outbid Helen. I asked Helen to pretend to be interested in more books than she really is just to keep Nigel getting his wallet out.\r\nTarquin: Hah hah! I imagine she was only too happy to oblige. \r\nQuentin: Naturally. Top sort, that Helen.\r\nTarquin: What was that book they were bidding so hard over last time?\r\nQuentin: Oh. That was that book on Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore. I think I have about three copies of that around the shop priced up at ten zlotys each.\r\nTarquin: And what did Nigel end up paying?\r\nQuentin: 52 zlotys in the end. I could barely keep the smile off my face.\r\nTarquin: But it's really only the fun and games I think. He must have known he was overpaying and just doing it for a lark, because of the social evening.\r\nQuentin: Yes, that's probably it. Which is why I like to be generous with the wine and cheese. Especially the wine, I might add.\r\nTarquin: Yes. That's from Peter's company right?\r\nQuentin: indeed. And I can take orders for crates of them at a special \"Quentin price\" only on the evening of the unboxing. I'll be doing that tonight as well if you want anything for Christmas wine-wise.
